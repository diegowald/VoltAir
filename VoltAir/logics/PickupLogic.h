/**
 * @brief Defines a behavior that, when added to an Actor, makes it "collectable".
 *
 * When a Body, whose corresponding Actor is an Actor::PlayerActor if #allowNonPlayerPickup is @c
 * false, comes in contact with #actor, PickupLogic "collects" #actor. Collection involves:
 *   - Awarding #pickupValue points to the appropriate player, if necessary
 *   - Updating incremental achievements to the appropriate player, if necessary
 *   - Playing a #pickupSound
 *   - Marking collection so it is not repeated
 * This class does not handle any visual or physical state changes for the collectable #actor, so it
 * is up to the user to define these changes by connecting to the collected() signal.
